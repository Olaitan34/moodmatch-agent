## 🔌 A2A Protocol Integration

MoodMatch implements the [A2A Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/a2a-protocol) specification, making it compatible with any A2A client.

### Using with Telex

[Telex](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/telex) is a universal A2A client:

1. Install Telex (if not already installed)
2. Add MoodMatch to your Telex configuration:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "MoodMatch",
      "url": "http://localhost:5001/a2a/moodmatch",
      "description": "Get mood-based music, movie, and book recommendations"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Start chatting:
```
User: I'm feeling anxious about an upcoming presentation
Telex: [Routes to MoodMatch]
MoodMatch: I understand that pre-presentation anxiety... [recommendations]
```

### Integration with Other Agents

MoodMatch can be composed with other A2A agents:

```
User → Telex → [Your Task Agent] → MoodMatch → Response
```

Example: A productivity agent could delegate mood management to MoodMatch when detecting user stress.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `Import "fastapi" could not be resolved`  
**Solution**: Install dependencies: `pip install -e .`

**Issue**: `Agent not initialized`  
**Solution**: Check your `.env` file has all required API keys

**Issue**: `Rate limit exceeded`  
**Solution**: Wait a few minutes or check API quotas

**Issue**: `No recommendations found`  
**Solution**: Agent will gracefully handle service failures. Check API keys are valid.

**Issue**: `CORS errors in browser`  
**Solution**: CORS is enabled for all origins in development. For production, configure `allow_origins` in `main.py`
